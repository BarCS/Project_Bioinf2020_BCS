### Discusión 
First, I did the quality analysis of three lines of RAD_seq using data from Rochette et al. (2017). In general, data quality was good, it was observed that the sequences contained the components obtained by the barcode and restriction enzyme used in most of the cases.

In second part of the analysis was observed the number of variants (loci and snps) according to the variation of the value of n= 1-3. In the plots, it was notable that the highest number of snps and loci was presented with a n= 3, when m was manintained with a value of 2, which could indicate that n=3 and m=2 are good parameters to continue with following analyses.
